## üîç TROUBLESHOOTING

### If you still don't see "Personal access tokens":

**Check 1: Verify you're in personal settings**
- URL should be: `https://github.com/settings/profile`
- Page title should show your username, not "WebWaka"

**Check 2: Look for these items in left sidebar:**
- Profile
- Account
- Appearance
- Accessibility
- Notifications
- Billing and plans
- Emails
- Password and authentication
- SSH and GPG keys
- Organizations
- Repositories
- Packages
- Copilot
- Pages
- Saved replies
- Security log
- Sponsorship log
- **Developer settings** ‚Üê This should be at the bottom

**Check 3: If Developer settings is missing:**
- Try logging out and back in
- Clear browser cache
- Try a different browser
- Ensure you have the necessary permissions

### If you're a member of WebWaka organization:

**Verify Organization Permissions:**
1. Go to WebWaka organization settings
2. Check if you have "Owner" or "Admin" permissions
3. If you're only a "Member", you might need elevated permissions
