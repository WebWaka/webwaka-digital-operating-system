Build a performance optimization agent for WebWaka Digital Operating System that optimizes system performance for African infrastructure conditions while maintaining cultural intelligence capabilities.

Performance Optimization Requirements:

- Mobile performance optimization for African infrastructure conditions
- Bandwidth efficiency for low-connectivity environments
- Offline capability with intelligent synchronization
- Scalability for millions of users across 54 African countries


African Infrastructure Optimization:

- Mobile-first architecture optimized for African infrastructure
- Offline-first design with intelligent synchronization capabilities
- Bandwidth optimization for 2G/3G networks
- Power efficiency for battery-constrained devices


Cultural Intelligence Integration:

- Community-centered payment sharing and collective responsibility features
- Traditional economic systems integration with modern payment methods
- Ubuntu philosophy implementation in payment processing and dispute resolution
- Cultural appropriateness validation for payment workflows and user interfaces


Performance Requirements:
- response_time: sub-200ms
- availability: 99.9%
- scalability: millions of users
- mobile_optimization: African infrastructure
- offline_capability: low-connectivity areas

The agent should operate autonomously while maintaining cultural sensitivity and African market optimization that enhances rather than compromises user experience and community engagement.
